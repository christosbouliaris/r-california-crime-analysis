# R-california-crime-analysis
Exploratory and statistical analysis of California crime datasets â€” including preprocessing, descriptive statistics, visualization, and predictive modeling with Naive Bayes (R)
##  Project Goals & Results
The aim of this project was to analyze California crime and law enforcement datasets (from Kaggle) using R language in order to apply statistical methods.
### Goals 
- Import and preprocess CSV datasets.
- Identify missing values and outliers and decide how to handle them.
- Explore data distributions (e.g. population, violent crimes) and test the normality.
- Visualize crime categories and spatial patterns across counties.
- Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis).
- Analyze correlations among key attributes.
- Apply Naive Bayes Classification to evaluate predictive performance.
### Results
- Discovered that crime distributions are **skewed**, not normally distributed.
- Identified **outliers** in population and law enforcement numbers, which represent real major cities and were kept.
- Found strong correlation between **population size and crime rates**.
- Mapped crime distribution across California counties, highlighting crime hotspots.
- Naive Bayes classification achieved **reasonable accuracy**, showing potential but also limitations due to dataset complexity.
